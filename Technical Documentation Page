        <h2>Introduction</h2>
      </header>
        <p>Glassblowing has been around for thousands of years and used by many
        cultures. There are two main facets to the glassblowing realm; one is
        tableware such as cups and dishes and the other is art. While it is often
        common that the two were mixed together to form artistic tableware.
        Contemporary glassworking techniques are still very similar to those which
        were used over the past thousand years.</p>
        <p>The glass used in glassblowing is usually soda-lime glass. This is
        made of sand and soda lime ash along with a few other additives in a
        furnace. The glass is transferred from a crucible in the furnace into a
        blowpipe so that air can be puffed into it. The glass is then formed
        and reheated repeatedly until the desired end goal is achieved. The
        finished product is then put into an annealer oven to slowly come down
        to room temperature.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Equipment">
      <header>
        <h2>Equipment</h2>
      </header>
        <p>Tools used for glassblowing are fairly universal between artists.
        The essential shop tools stationed in every hotshop are the:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Glass Melting Furnace</strong> - This is a well insulated
          container made of fire bricks and cement. A crucible resides inside of
          the <code>furnace</code> and is what holds the molten glass. The
          crucible is able to withstand the extreme temperatures usually
          produced by the gas torches to heat the furnace.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Glory Hole</strong> - Once the glass had been gathered,
          the <code>glory hole</code> is used to reheat glass to its working
          temperature. There are rotating doors on the front of the <code>glory
          hole</code> that can be opened and closed to allow for bigger pieces
          to move in and out of the glory hole.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Yolk</strong> - Something is needed to support the blowpipe
          or punty as there is a large moment applied on your wrists with a heavy
          mass on the other end. The <code>yolk</code> is a mobile piece of
          equipment responsible for supporting the blowpipe or punty as it is
          placed into the glory hole. </li><br>
          <li><strong>Bench</strong> - Standing all day in the hotshop would get
          very strenuous on the body and isn't comfortable. <code>Benches</code>
          in the hotshop are specially made with extension bars for the blowpipe
          or punty to sit and be rolled on while working on the hot glass. The
          glassblower sits on the </code>bench</code> with the blowpipe or punty
          above their lap.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Marver</strong> - A <code>marver</code> is a large smooth
          steel surface used to roll glass back and forth on to shape and cool
          it.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Pipe Warmer</strong> - Blowpipes and punties need to be
          heated before they are able to be dipped into the molten glass so that
          the glass will stick to them. <code>Pipe warmers</code> are small
          furnaces, usually electric, that are used to preform this function.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Pipe Cooler</strong> - As the blowpipes and punties are
          made of metal they conduct heat all the way up to the handle. This can
          cause injury to the glassblower, so a <code>pipe cooler</code> is used
          to cool down pipes with stream of water.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Break Off Box</strong> - The <code>break off box</code> is
          used to catch the final piece oncew it is all finished and knocked off
          of the punty before it goes into the annealer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The essential hand tools in every hotshop are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Blowpipes and Puntys</strong> - <code>Blowpipes</code> are
          hollow steel tubes that are used to gather glass and blow air into it.
          <code>Puntys</code> are solid steel rods that are used as handles to
          attach to other glass pieces.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Blocks</strong> - Usually made of cherry wood, these
          carved <code>blocks</code> look like deep spoons with a cut out in
          the side. They are used to shape the gathers and small bubbles.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Wet Newspaper</strong> - <code>Wet newspaper</code> is
          used to shape larger bubbles by hand and get more organic looking
          shapes into the glass.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Jacks</strong> - <code>Jacks</code> are use to neck the
          sculpture, cut lines into the work or for sculpting.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Tweezers</strong> - Mainly used for sculpting purposes,
          <code>tweezers</code> can also be used to guide tools or pipes/rods
          while working.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Shears</strong> - <code>Shears</code> are robust scissors
          used to trim or cut the glass.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Sophiettas</strong> - If a piece had already been broken off
          of the blowpipe, a <code>sophietta</code> allows for air to be blown
          directly into the piece through an existing hole.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Paddle</strong> - This is a wooden <code>paddle</code>
          used to flatten the bottom of the vessel as well as a heat sheild when
          working at the bench.</li><br>
          <li><strong>Hand torches</strong> - <code>Hand torches</code> are used
          to warm up the connection point if the glassblower senses that the
          punty or blowpipe is getting too cold. It can also be used to provide
          more heat when stretching the glass.</li><br>

        </ul>
        <p>Don't forget to use the proper safety equipment while working such as
        safety glasses and long-sleeve clothing that won't melt or burn, also
        to have a first aid kit around. "Blood, sweat and tears" isn't a saying
        just to be taken literally in the hotshop; it's a dangerous place!</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Gathering_Glass">
      <header>
        <h2>Gathering Glass</h2>
      </header>
        <p>To start the vessel making process you need to gather the glass onto
        your heated blowpipe. This is done by dipping the blowpipe into the
        crucible at an angle of about 45 degrees and rotating to accumulate
        glass. Once you've gathered up as much as you can in one gather, pull
        the blowpipe out of the furnace and keep it rotating. This will make a
        nice ball on the end of the blowpipe. If you want to elongate the gather
        orient the pipe downward, and vise versa if you want to shorten the
        gather and make it more stout.</p>
        <p>Depending on the size of the vessel that you want to make you may have
        to repeat the gather process multiple times. Swiftness is key as the
        previous gathers can melt off of blowpipe back into the furnace. </p>
        <p>There are two main methods to obtain a gather. They are the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The Coat Method</strong> - With this method you get the
            cleanest and most even gather. However, this method adds the least
            amount of glass to the gather each time. After rotating in the
            crucible a few times withdraw while still rotating, trailing off
            any excess glass.</li><br>
          <li><strong>The Collection Method</strong> - This method gathers a
            large clump of glass that is not very even around the center of the
            blowpipe. It gathers the most amount of glass between the two
            methods. Dip the blowpipe into the crucible and keep turning. Once
            the gather is large enough for your liking pull out the gather and
            keep rotating. Try not to trail the excess glass off.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Blocking">
      <header>
        <h2>Blocking</h2>
      </header>
        <p>Now that you have a gather the size that you want to work with it is
        time to even it out.  Sit down at the bench and place the blowpipe on
        it, keep it rolling back and forth. Take the ladle-looking wooden
        block out of the water bucket (if it was not in the bucket before you
        started, make sure that you place it there before starting) and start
        to shape the glob of glass into a nice bubble shape.</p>
        <p>Put a few puffs of air into the blowpipe to begin forming a bubble
        inside of the molten glass. Make sure not to puff to hard as you can
        blow out the glass very thin and pop it, like popping bubble gum. If
        the block starts smoking too much re-dip it into the water bucket to
        get it wet again. Use the block until the glass has a nice even shape
        suitable for gathering over or blowing out.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Reheating">
      <header>
        <h2>Reheating</h2>
      </header>
        <p>Reheating will consume about half of the time you spend while working
        in the hotshop as a glassblower. This process is self-explanatory.
        When the glass gets too cold to work, it needs to be warmed back up to
        working temperature. First the heat shield doors need to be moved out
        of the way (by an assistant) so that you can enter the glass into the
        glory hole. The doors are then shut to keep the heat in the furnace
        and begin to bake the glass. Position the glass so that you are only
        heating up the areas that you want to work with the torch inside. If
        you would like a slower heating process, place the piece in the other
        half of the glory hole, opposite the burner. If you would like to heat
        up the glass faster, place it close to the burner so that the flame is
        touching it.</p>
        <p>When the heat shield doors are closed, the piece is considered to
        be enclosed or “boxed in”. A large amount of heat is radiated off
        the doors and back into the glory hole, so the closer you can get
        your piece to the doors the faster it will heat up. Be careful not
        to touch the doors on the way in or out, or while spinning the piece
        inside as you will get dust on it and potentially even stick to the
        glory hole. The faster you spin the pipe while the glass is hot, the
        wider and shorter it will get. Depending on the shape of the vessel that
        you want, you can use this to your advantage. Make sure to keep the
        piece you are working on centered on the pipe while spinning it or else
        you will encounter problems later on. </p>
        <p>While reheating, you will want to position yourself in a spot where
        you feel comfortable working. You don’t want to stand too close to the
        glory hole as it is very hot, but you also don’t want to stand too far
        away to make it comfortable in your wrists. Maintaining control while
        also remaining relatively cool is the main goal hear. Try not to heat
        too deeply in the glory hole as it will heat your pipe up unnecessarily.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Shaping_and_Blowing">
      <header>
        <h2>Shaping and Blowing</h2>
      </header>
        <p>After reheating the piece, it is time to shape it and make it bigger
        if need be. By blowing a few puffs of air into the through the blowpipe
        the glass will expand at the hottest and least resistive parts. Take it
        step by step as to not over inflate the glass past the desired size or
        pop it. You can blow against the glass to solidify the outside. </p>
        <p>Once it’s at the right size set it on the bench and keep it rotating
        back and forth. You can take your wet news paper and start to shape it
        (dampen it if it is too dry). The newspaper needs to be damp so that the
        steam created between the paper and glass will protect the paper and
        your hand. Using the newspaper will produce more organic shapes in the
        glass and allow you to “feel” the glass more. Start at the neck area
        (the connection between the blowpipe and the glass) and then work out
        toward the bottom of the piece. Make sure that the neck is cooled so
        that it is stable enough to support the rest of the piece. Let gravity
        do the work here, don’t try to brute force the shape into existence.</p>
        <p>When the newspaper starts to smoke excessively, dampen it again. If
        the paper begins to combust, the ash can stick to the glass and ruin
        your work. New newspaper blocks may need to be broken in a few times to
        form a nice layer of carbon on them. After the layer of carbon forms,
        the newspaper shouldn’t need too much water and won’t burn easily.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Marvering">
      <header>
        <h2>Marvering</h2>
      </header>
        <p>If you need a longer, cylindrical shape you can use the marver table,
        rolling the hot glass back and forth elongating the piece and cooling it.
        Changing the angle of the pipe is how you change the shape of the piece
        you’re working. You can also orient the pipe downward to make more of a
        conical shape as you roll back and forth. Holding the pipe horizontally
        with the surface of the marver will make a nice cylinder. Orienting the
        pipe upward will cause the bottom to have a conical taper. Be careful
        not to over do it when you are marvering as you can squish the piece in
        the angled orientations or stretch it too long and skinny in the
        horizontal orientation. Air marvering is also very important when trying
        to assess the behavior of your bubble.</p>
        <p>Marvering the hot glass is also a way to cool thin spots in the glass
        so that they don’t get out of control. If the glass starts to get a
        little too thin, run it over the marver a couple times and it should
        cool enough to keep the situation under control. When changing the
        orientation, change it quickly so that the glass doesn’t fold and you
        get your desired shape.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Necking">
      <header>
        <h2>Necking</h2>
      </header>
        <p>The goal of this process is to create a nice, clean break-off line
        between your vessel and the pipe. First reheat the whole piece in the
        glory hole, focus mostly where the neck is going to be. Return to the
        bench and set the pipe down after you’re seated. Grab your jacks and
        gently start squeezing the area where the neck is going to be, as
        close to the blowpipe as possible. Make sure that the line is not on
        top of the pipe or you will struggle with making a clean break. You
        can stretch the neck out to that it becomes longer and thinner. Again,
        this is and incremental process, so take it step by step as not to
        over do it. If you pinch the neck too hard it can close up the vessel
        thereby trashing your piece of work. Once satisfied with the neck of
        your vessel go in for one more reheat. When back at the bench make
        one final crisp line in the neck, this will be the break line.</p>
        <p>The farther the end of the piece is away from the neck, the harder
        it will be to neck the vessel. Hold the jacks at the same orientation
        and move back and forth with the glass as you roll it on the bench. If
        this is not done in harmony it is very easy to knock the vessel off
        center.  Fix the off center vessel by allowing gravity to let the
        piece fall back on center.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Flattening_the_Bottom">
      <header>
        <h2>Flattening the Bottom</h2>
      </header>
        <p>Now reheat the glass but take care not to heat the neck up too much
        as it may start to slump and ruin your neckline. Blow the bottom of
        the vessel out a fit further if needed and shape it either on the
        marver or with your newspaper to the desired shape. If there is still
        enough heat left in the piece you can paddle the bottom and start to
        flatten it. Reheat just the bottom again, enough to paddle it but not
        lose its new shape. You can also use your jacks to flatten the bottom
        of the vessel if it isn’t too large. </p>
        <p>If the glass is too thin and too hot the bottom may concave a
        little bit and create a “kick foot”. This effect can be avoided by
        maintaining a thick bottom. If this happens and you'd like to make it
        completely flat, simply blow into and try to smooth it back out. Don’t
        push too hard when paddling the bottom as you may distort the overall

        <h2>Attaching A Punty and Breaking Off</h2>
      </header>
        <p>This process is used to transfer the worked piece from the blowpipe
        to the final working rod, the punty. The punty is attached on the
        reverse axis of the vessel via a cold seal. This is a seal that is made
        when the vessel is cooler than the glass on the punty and is much more
        easily broken off.</p>
        <p>There a few things that need to be checked before the punty is
        applied. Is the vessel that your are puntying up to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>on-center</li>
          <li>blown out and shaped the way you want it to finally look</li>
          <li>necked properly, does it have a clearly defined neckline</li>
          <li>cool enough to punty up to and not still fluid</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make sure that you are using the right diameter rod for the size
        piece you are working on. If you are working on a small vessel, a small
        diameter punty is suitable. However, if you are working on a larger
        vessel then a larger punty rod is required so that the piece doesn’t
        prematurely break off and smash into the ground. Make haste once you
        have attached the punty as the life of your finished work may be
        contingent on it. Lastly, the punty needs to be applied to the absolute
        center of the vessel as you will be spinning and finishing the piece on
        the punty.</p>
        <p>Before making your punty <strong>MAKE SURE TO FLASH YOUR VESSEL</strong>
        for around five seconds. After flashing your vessel place it on the
        bench or a set of yokes. Prepare the punty by taking a small gather on
        the end of the rod and then marvering it down. You want the glob on the
        end of the rod to be as evenly distributed around the rod as possible so
        that you can get a good center point. With a tipped point on the end of
        the punty you are ready to attach it to the bottom of the vessel. Try
        not to cool the tip of the punty too much as it needs to be hot enough
        to stick to the vessel. Go back to the bench and grab your tweezers, use
        them to guide the punty into place and stick it to the vessel.
        <strong>YOU ONLY HAVE ONE ATTEMPT TO GET THIS RIGHT</strong>! Check to
        see that the punty is and the vessel are concentric and move around
        slightly with the tweezers to get into the right spot if necessary.</p>
        <p>To break the vessel off of the blowpipe you now dunk your entire hand
        while holding the tweezers into the water bucket and chill the neckline
        by allowing the water to run off of your hand onto the neckline. This
        should stress the glass out and crack it right at the neckline leaving
        a nice crack that goes all the way around the neck of the piece. Do not
        let the water fall on the piece itself as the piece will crack and your
        work will be ruined. Then take the back end of your tweezers, while
        holding the punty firmly and give the blowtube a nice firm tap. This
        should break the vessel free from the pipe and remain on the punty,
        repeat these two steps if the vessel fails to break free.</p>

        <h2>Finishing and Annealing</h2>
      </header>
        <p>Give the vessel one final flash in the glory hole, this time focusing
        on the neck instead of the base. Spend a good amount of time in the
        glory hole as it will take some time to heat the piece back up. Make
        sure to flash the punty a few times so that it is also warmed back up,
        if not it may break off prematurely. When the lip no longer appears to
        be jagged from the break off go back to the bench. Using your jacks
        open the neck up to the diameter that you desire by pinching them shut
        and inserting them into the opening. Slowly open your jacks while
        rotating back and forth to ream the mouth open. You may want to apply
        some beeswax to your jacks so that the glide on the glass more smoothly
        but be careful not to apply to much because it will drip into the piece.
        </p>
        <p>With the mouth of your vessel shaped to your liking it is time to
        take the final step of breaking the vessel off of the punty and putting
        it into the annealer. You do this the same way that you break off the
        vessel from the blowpipe. Dip your hand into the water bucked and then
        let the water drip onto the punty. Be sure to have it over the break off
        box or have someone there to catch it because it will fall off of the
        punty very shortly after shocking and tapping it. Immediately grab it
        out of the break off box and transport it into the annealer. Try to hold
        the vessel for as little time as possible to avoid stressing it and
        cracking it. Do not drop it into the annealer, place it in lightly and
        then close the doors quickly behind you.</p>
